# pictopercept

## Project structure
- `pictopercept` -> Holds the web/Flask's python backend code, such as the `views.py` and `db.py`, that define the routes and what gets shown.
- `pictopercept/templates` -> Where all the **HTML** files are located, which are the final web pages that the user will see. They use basic *Flask/Jinja2* templating, to pass variables from *Python* to them.
- `pictopercept/static` -> Holds the static files such as `JavaScript` and `CSS` code, fonts and images.
- `pictopercept/lib` -> A custom library that defines custom types and default survey handlers to make defining new surveys easier.
- `pictopercept/surveys` -> Here is where you should place all the custom surveys to show in the website. You can view the base survey definition at `pictopercept/lib/common_types.py` to view all the needed attributes and functions to implement per survey.

## Developing
First, make sure to check [Environment Variables](#environment-variables) and [Storage and Database](#storage-and-database) to setup everything properly.

It is recommended to use some sort of virtual environment, such as `venv` (there are other alternatives such as *pipenv* or *conda*), which will help get and manage the correct versions of python-related libraries:
```
python3 -m venv .venv
```
Then, to activate the environment:
```
source .venv/bin/activate
```
Once done, you can execute the following to install all the python dependencies:
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
Then, run the server using:
```
flask run --debug
```
This command will start the local website in the port 5000. You can visit [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) in your browser to view it.

## Environment Variables
There is a provided `.env.example` where you can view all the env variables used by our program.
This are:
- `FLASK_SECRET_KEY`: A random hex key that Flask will use to encrypt session data into the cookies.
- `FETCH_PASSWORD`: A random hex key to use that is needed to fetch all the survey data (such as user answers).
- `MONGODB_URI`, `DATABASE_PATH` and `DATASETS_PATH`: Please check [Storage and Database](#storage-and-database)

## Storage and Database
### Deployed on Surf SRAM
When Pictopercept is deployed in **SURF SRAM**, it uses two attached storages named `db` and `pictopercept_datasets`, which are attached in the server's `/data/db/` and `/data/pictopercept_datasets/`, respectively.
It will also use the `mongo` service that is defined in the [docker-compose.yml](./docker-compose.yml) file.

Because of this, the ENV used by the deployment (appart from the secret keys) will just be:
- `MONGODB_URI`: `mongo:27017`
- `DATABASE_PATH`: `/data/db`
- `DATASETS_PATH`: `/data/pictopercept_datasets`

### Developing locally
#### Database
When developing Pictopercept locally, we need some extra external services such as MongoDB running and a dataset folder. There are two recommended options:

##### In memory via `mongomock` (non-persistent)
You can also pass the flag `-debug` when opening the server (via `flask run --debug`) to use the in-memory database. However, this is not persistent, and MongoDB mock service will restart on each `flask` run/update.

##### MongoDB using Docker service (persistent locally)
One easy way would just be using the Docker Compose service's MongoDB locally. To do this, you can run it and just set the `MONGODB_URI` to `mongodb://localhost:27017/`.

#### Database and Dataset folders
You will need to create two folders wherever you want and point both envs to those folders (`DATABASE_PATH` and `DATASETS_PATH`).
